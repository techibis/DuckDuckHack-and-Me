# DuckDuckHack and Me
I am a big fan of DuckDuckHack because it empowers people to be part of something big that many people will be using.  It is an open community, which means that anyone can join DuckDuckHack, even you. (Yes You!)
Below are a series of documents that I have created with some ideas about how I can use my skills to improve DuckDuckHack.  I am looking for collaborators, so if you are interested, reply to my post on the DuckDuckHack forum.  Talk to you soon!
